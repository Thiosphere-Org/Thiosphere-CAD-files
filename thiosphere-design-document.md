# **Thiosphere Design Document**

**Version 0.1 | Modular Open Source Space**

---

## **Executive Summary**

The Thiosphere™ is an open source hardware shelter system designed to create modular, efficient spaces that address the underutilization of urban infrastructure. Built on the principle "Domus Opus Est" (the work of creating space is never ending), the Thiosphere offers a standardized, flat-packable solution that transforms half a parking space into functional, beautiful environments for work, shelter, or community use.

## **Project Vision**

### **Core Philosophy**

We have formatted our world for automobiles, dedicating vast amounts of urban space to parking and vehicle infrastructure while leaving communities with limited options for affordable, flexible spaces. The Thiosphere addresses this imbalance by providing an open source solution that reclaims and repurposes underutilized space.
